# Hosted at https://pattyrich.github.io/github-pages/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm i && npm start` should be all you need to start working with the project. 

`server/server.py` will need to be run if you want to work on the `bingo` section locally. There is a requirements.txt in that folder.
